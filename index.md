## Helping the World Define and Pursue Goals <sup>[*](/assets/images/infty.mp4)</sup>
Infinity Family is a group of organizations with a shared mission to help the world cooperate and create a formal universally understandable language for intent sharing between cultures and entities in general. Collectively, we strive for the world where everything that anyone truly wishes would exist.

### Solution
