## Helping the World Define and Pursue Goals

Infinity Family is a group of organizations with a shared mission to help the world cooperate and create a formal universally understandable language for intent sharing between cultures and entities in general. Collectively, we strive for the world where everything that anyone truly wishes would exist.

### Solution

We propose a meta-vocabulary rooted in neutral mathematical equation model, intended as a basis for an open solution for linked data that allows data publishers to showcase the intent and the substance of actions.
