### Why we need a new language for data sharing?
To integrate our efforts and pursue goals together.

### How is Infinity proposed language better than vocabularies available today?
Infinity organizes data around goals, ideas and plans. This way, it's easy to cooperate to solve humanity's problems 
and replicate solutions in different locations.

### I want to help. How do I get involved?
If you’re a subject matter expert, join us to review models at [wefindx.net](wefindx.net). 
If you’re an organisation, contact us to donate data and make it openly available for public, 
so that everyone can use it to solve humanity’s challenges. 
The process will be managed by [WeFindX](https://wefindx.org) team and 
the data will be published through a digital platform the Infinity Project.
