### Why we need a new vocabulary for data exchange?
To integrate our efforts and pursue goals together.

### How is Infinity proposed vocabulary different than vocabularies available today?
Infinity organizes all data in context of purpose. It strives to serve a purpose of being a pragmatic meta-vocubulary for all vocabularies.

We support an idea of openness and transparency. Our goal is to organize and provide data openly to public, so that everyone can benefit from it.

### I want to help. How do I get involved?
If you’re a subject matter expert from mathematics, ontology, robotics or open knowledge, join us to review models at [wefindx.net](http://wefindx.net). 

If you’re an organisation, contact us to donate data and make it openly available for public, 
so that everyone can use it to solve humanity’s challenges. 
The process will be managed by [WeFindX](https://wefindx.org) team and 
the data will be published here and through a digital platform - the Infinity Project.
