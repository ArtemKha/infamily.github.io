### Why we need a new language for data sharing?
To integrate our efforts and pursue goals together.

### How is Infinity proposed language different than vocabularies available today?
Infinity organizes data around goals, ideas and plans. This way, it's easy to cooperate around missions 
and replicate solutions in different locations.

We support an idea of openness and transparency. Our goal is to organize and provide data openly to public, so that everyone can benefit from it.

### I want to help. How do I get involved?
If you’re a subject matter expert from mathematics, ontology, robotics or open knowledge, join us to review models at [wefindx.net](wefindx.net). 

If you’re an organisation, contact us to donate data and make it openly available for public, 
so that everyone can use it to solve humanity’s challenges. 
The process will be managed by [WeFindX](https://wefindx.org) team and 
the data will be published through a digital platform the Infinity Project.

### What data can organizations donate?
Humanities challenges, for example specified [SDGs](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) and procedural know-how from projects that use technology and science for good.
